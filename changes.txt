a method getcolumnnames(string partial_text)


The JOIN predicate is a special type of comparison predicate. The rules for a comparison predicate apply here.
Each expression (expression) specified in the JOIN predicate must contain a column specification. The column specification of the first expression and the column specification of the second expression must be specified in such a way that both column specifications refer to different table names or reference names. The value of the first expression and the value of the second expression must be comparable.
Only those rows from the table specified in the JOIN predicate are transferred to the result table for which a row is found in the other table specified in the JOIN predicate in accordance with the comparison (specified by the comparison operator comp_op).
