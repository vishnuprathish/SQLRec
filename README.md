SQLRec
======

we present a recommendation engine for SQL
query language that can be used in the everyday life of a

SQL query writer. We use a schema aware approach un-
like other systems designed for similar purposes where user

history from query logs is used. The key features of our

recommendation engine are auto improvisation of attribute

recommendations as the user types query and join predicate

recommendation using statistical inference. We use a rank-
ing system with weightages for various parameters at di

ent contexts to recommend keywords, table names, column

names and boolean conditions.

We evaluate the system using query logs on northwind database

and it is shown that we are able to recommend useful fea-
tures 99% of times in the top ten results and over 90% of

times in the 

rst two results.
