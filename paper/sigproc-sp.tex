\section{Introduction}
SQL is a universal language used by software engineers on a regular basis. Databases schemas are often designed by experts who are aware of the system and programmers often end up not having much familiarity with the schema. A software engineer who writes queries in a development environment based on this schema he will have to go back and forth to see the schema information to write effective queries. Doing this on a large scale system can be a tedious process. To explain this problem, we take the example of a user searching for the patient record of Englishman ``William Scott" in an hospital database. Schema complexity poses as the first challenge. Most hospitals have records of their patients in varied schema, typical to each department. Second, the user may not be fully aware of the exact values of the selection predicates, and may give only a misspelled or partial attribute value (in this case, the user knows him as ``Will"). Third, we would like the user to issue queries that are meaningful in terms of result size. A query listing all the patients in the hospital would not be helpful to the user, and in some cases could also be computationally expensive for the system. Lastly, we do not expect the user to be proficient in SQL to access the database. 

Structured query models like XQuery, and the wider known SQL are the current existing means provided by database systems to allow users to express complex query semantics. Though powerful, these query models are in essence diﬃcult for users to adopt because they require users to fully understand the structure of the database (i.e., schema) and to express queries in terms of that particular structure. Most often, a developer due to inexperience, unfamiliarity with the database schema or mere lack of attention to computational complexity of the query, fails to use the optimal query. Recommendation engines for a SQL query have the potential to ease a programmer's life by providing him with possible suggestions and optimizations. Providing informed autosuggestions while writing the query can therefore ease a programmer's life.  We use an informed approach towards this end by using the information in hand like database schema, sample of data from the tables, already written partial query structure and semantic information on the schema. These information can be effectively used to give auto suggestions to the user who is writing the query. 

We present a simple recommender which makes the process of query writing easier.  Illustrating with an example, consider the following query and associated recommendations:
SELECT (suggest possible clauses to start the query)
Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName,   Orders.OrderDate ( No recommendations or as-you-type suggestions; incase of multiple column names, give preference to column within the same table) 
FROM Orders (autofill table name based on suffix of SELECT Statement; incase of multiple table names, give preference to tables containing all the columns within itself over tables with join possibilities) 
INNER JOIN Customers (suggest possible tables on which inner join could be done based on the data from Orders table) 
ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID (suggest possible join predicate based on tables and column names); 

In this paper we discuss some observations which have helped us rank the suggestions, the implementation of the tool, and the tool`s evaluation using the standard Northwind database. We present a schema-aware recommendation system for SQL queries with a simple instant-response user interface. To evaluate the tool, we retrace the steps of some common queries used on Northwind database and evaluate the usefulness of the query recommendations given by the system.  

\section{Implementation}
Typically, the body of a paper is organized
into a hierarchical structure, with numbered or unnumbered
headings for sections, subsections, sub-subsections, and even
smaller sections.  The command \texttt{{\char'134}section} that
precedes this paragraph is part of such a
hierarchy.\footnote{This is the second footnote.  It
starts a series of three footnotes that add nothing
informational, but just give an idea of how footnotes work
and look. It is a wordy one, just so you see
how a longish one plays out.} \LaTeX\ handles the numbering
and placement of these headings for you, when you use
the appropriate heading commands around the titles
of the headings.  If you want a sub-subsection or
smaller part to be unnumbered in your output, simply append an
asterisk to the command name.  Examples of both
numbered and unnumbered headings will appear throughout the
balance of this sample document.

Because the entire article is contained in
the \textbf{document} environment, you can indicate the
start of a new paragraph with a blank line in your
input file; that is why this sentence forms a separate paragraph.

\subsection{Global Index Data Structure}
The implementation is irrespective of the type of database used underneath. A global index structure is populated which contains the schema information from database when a connect statement is detected. This is simply an object with sufficient methods and attributes to represent a schema and recommend on them. An overloaded ‘populate’ method is written for each of the supported types of databases(currently only Mysql is supported) to populate this index. Hence adding support for new databases becomes relatively straightforward. 
The schema information essentially contains the table names, column names and datatype and key information for each of the tables. Apart from these a fraction of data is also collected from these 
Each database has its own way of extracting schema through the populate method. But the index structure just contains the information that is common to all relational databases in the market. Hence it simply becomes a matter of a few lines of code into the well defined interface of DBindex populate method to extend the feature to any databases.  

\subsection{Math Equations}
You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of
the three are discussed in the next sections.

\subsubsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
A formula that appears in the running text is called an
inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
\textbf{math} environment, which can be
invoked with the usual \texttt{{\char'134}begin. . .{\char'134}end}
construction or with the short form \texttt{\$. . .\$}. You
can use any of the symbols and structures,
from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a
few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how
this equation: \begin{math}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsubsection{Display Equations}
A numbered display equation -- one set off by vertical space
from the text and centered horizontally -- is produced
by the \textbf{equation} environment. An unnumbered display
equation is produced by the \textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
and structures available in \LaTeX; this section will just
give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\subsection{Citations}
Citations to articles \cite{bowman:reasoning, clark:pct, braams:babel, herlihy:methodology},
conference
proceedings \cite{clark:pct} or books \cite{salas:calculus, Lamport:LaTeX} listed
in the Bibliography section of your
article will occur throughout the text of your article.
You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography;
you simply need to insert one of several citation commands with
a key of the item cited in the proper location in
the \texttt{.tex} file \cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.
The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely
identify each work; in this sample document, the key is
the first author's surname and a
word from the title.  This identifying key is included
with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file for your article.

The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file
are beyond the scope of this sample document, but more
information can be found in the \textit{Author's Guide},
and exhaustive details in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's
Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

This article shows only the plainest form
of the citation command, using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.
This is what is stipulated in the SIGS style specifications.
No other citation format is endorsed.

\subsection{Tables}
Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
placement for them is typically the top of the page
nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
on \textbf{tabular} material
is found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 1 is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed
dvi output of this document.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\ \hline
\O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\ \hline
$\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\ \hline
\$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\ \hline
$\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
\hline\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of
the page's live area, use the environment
\textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this wide
table will ``float" to a location deemed more desirable.
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 2 is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the
table here with the table in the printed dvi
output of this document.


\begin{table*}
\centering
\caption{Some Typical Commands}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Command&A Number&Comments\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}alignauthor} & 100& Author alignment\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}numberofauthors}& 200& Author enumeration\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\ \hline\end{tabular}
\end{table*}
% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!

\subsection{Figures}
Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the
best placement for them
is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest
their initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement
of figures, use the environment
\textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and its caption.

This sample document contains examples of \textbf{.eps}
and \textbf{.ps} files to be displayable with \LaTeX.  More
details on each of these is found in the \textit{Author's Guide}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\epsfig{file=fly.eps}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format).}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\epsfig{file=fly.eps, height=1in, width=1in}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format)
that has been resized with the \texttt{epsfig} command.}
\end{figure}


As was the case with tables, you may want a figure
that spans two columns.  To do this, and still to
ensure proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment
\textbf{figure*} to enclose the figure and its caption.

Note that either {\textbf{.ps}} or {\textbf{.eps}} formats are
used; use
the \texttt{{\char'134}epsfig} or \texttt{{\char'134}psfig}
commands as appropriate for the different file types.

\subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
Other common constructs that may occur in your article are
the forms for logical constructs like theorems, axioms,
corollaries and proofs.  There are
two forms, one produced by the
command \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} and the
other by the command \texttt{{\char'134}newdef}; perhaps
the clearest and easiest way to distinguish them is
to compare the two in the output of this sample document:

This uses the \textbf{theorem} environment, created by
the\linebreak\texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} command:
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\begin{theorem}
Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
\begin{displaymath}\int^b_af(t)dt = G(b) - G(a).\end{displaymath}
\end{theorem}

The other uses the \textbf{definition} environment, created
by the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command:
\newdef{definition}{Definition}
\begin{definition}
If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
unique number which has
logarithm $z$: \begin{displaymath}{\log e^z = z}\end{displaymath}
\end{definition}


Two lists of constructs that use one of these
forms is given in the
\textit{Author's  Guidelines}.

\begin{figure*}
\centering
\epsfig{file=flies.eps}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format)
that needs to span two columns of text.}
\end{figure*}
and don't forget to end the environment with
{figure*}, not {figure}!
 
There is one other similar construct environment, which is
already set up
for you; i.e. you must \textit{not} use
a \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to
create it: the \textbf{proof} environment.  Here
is a example of its use:
\begin{proof}
Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
\begin{displaymath}
\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
\end{displaymath}
Then
\begin{displaymath}
l=\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ]
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0\cdot L = 0,
\end{displaymath}
which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
\end{proof}

Complete rules about using these environments and using the
two different creation commands are in the
\textit{Author's Guide}; please consult it for more
detailed instructions.  If you need to use another construct,
not listed therein, which you want to have the same
formatting as the Theorem
or the Definition\cite{salas:calculus} shown above,
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} or the
\texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command,
respectively, to create it.

\subsection*{A {\secit Caveat} for the \TeX\ Expert}
Because you have just been given permission to
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to create a
new form, you might think you can
use \TeX's \texttt{{\char'134}def} to create a
new command: \textit{Please refrain from doing this!}
Remember that your \LaTeX\ source code is primarily intended
to create camera-ready copy, but may be converted
to other forms -- e.g. HTML. If you inadvertently omit
some or all of the \texttt{{\char'134}def}s recompilation will
be, to say the least, problematic.

\section{Conclusions}
This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
Appendices; brief samples of these
follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
this paper are to articles which have nothing to
do with the present subject and are used as
examples only.

\section{Headings in Appendices}
The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
the body of the article are different in the appendices.
In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
\textbf{section} is used to
indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
hierarchical structure
\textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
document in Appendix-appropriate form:
\subsection{Introduction}

\subsubsection*{A Caveat for the \TeX\ Expert}
\subsection{Conclusions}
\subsection{Acknowledgments}
\subsection{Additional Authors}
This section is inserted by \LaTeX; you do not insert it.
You just add the names and information in the
\texttt{{\char'134}additionalauthors} command at the start
of the document.
\subsection{References}
Generated by bibtex from your ~.bib file.  Run latex,
then bibtex, then latex twice (to resolve references)
to create the ~.bbl file.  Insert that ~.bbl file into
the .tex source file and comment out
the command \texttt{{\char'134}thebibliography}.
